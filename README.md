# This is a hardhat and smart contract practice.

##### I wrote a ERC20 contract, ERC721 NFT contract and a nft vendor contract which receives the erc20 token in exchange of the nfts.

##### Implemented: ERC20,ERC721,Access Control(Ownable)

##### Deploy script contains deployment and etherscan verifycation.

##### Testing script contains throuout uint test that tested three contracts' functionality.

##### Three contract was deployed and verified at rinkeby testnet.
